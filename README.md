🌿 AI-Based Plant Health Detection System
Using Computer Vision & Google Teachable Machine

This project is a plant-health detection system designed to analyse the condition of money plants using Computer Vision. It enables users to upload a plant image and instantly receive predictions on whether the plant is healthy, stressed, or wilted.

🚀 Project Overview

Plants cannot communicate their discomfort, and early signs of plant stress often go unnoticed. This leads to reduced growth, low productivity, and, in severe cases, plant loss.

Our system uses AI to give plants a “voice” by detecting subtle patterns in leaf textures and colours.

🧠 Technology Used
1. Computer Vision (AI Domain)

Identifies and analyses visual features of plant leaves.

2. Google Teachable Machine

Model trained on images of:

Healthy money plants

Stressed/unhealthy money plants

Generates real-time predictions with confidence scores.

3. Weebly (Website Builder)

Created an easy-to-use interface.

Integrated the trained model using a button linking to the Teachable Machine model.

🌐 Features

Upload plant image or use live camera

Instant health detection (healthy / stressed / wilted)

Confidence-level predictions

Simple and beginner-friendly interface

Designed primarily for home plants, especially money plants

🔗 Project Workflow

User visits the website

Clicks the “Check Plant Health” button

Redirects to Teachable Machine interface

Uploads a plant image

Model analyzes and displays the prediction

📝 My Reflection

This project helped me translate an idea into a working AI system.
I learned how to integrate a machine learning model into a live website, coordinate team roles, and create a user-friendly prototype. It strengthened my technical, leadership, and problem-solving skills.

🔮 Future Enhancements

Extend model to more plant species

Improve training dataset for higher accuracy

Add care recommendations based on predictions

Build a mobile application

Integrate real-time camera detection directly in the website
